I have a project called ServeEase â€” a Spring Boot backend with a React frontend. 
I want to add a simple AI-powered customer support chatbot. 
The chatbot should:
- Answer user queries about ServeEase features (registration, login, booking process, ratings, etc.)
- Use an external free LLM API (prefer Hugging Face Inference API, not OpenAI/Gemini which need paid keys).
- Work only as a support assistant: it should NOT make real bookings or modify data.
- The backend should expose a /api/chat endpoint that accepts a user query, calls the LLM API with a system prompt, and returns the chatbot's response.
- The frontend should have a chat widget (input box + chat history) that connects to this endpoint.

Tasks for you:
1. Create a new Spring Boot module with ChatController, ChatService, and configuration to call the Hugging Face Inference API.
2. Show me where to place this module in my existing folder structure.
3. Provide a sample system prompt that ensures the chatbot stays as a polite support assistant and never performs actual actions.
4. Provide example React component code for a simple chat UI connected to /api/chat.
5. Ensure the whole solution is beginner-friendly and can run with just a free Hugging Face API key.

Please generate the backend and frontend code snippets step by step, explain the flow clearly, and keep everything in line with best practices for my existing ServeEase project.
