6. Local Service Provider Finder

Problem Solved:
People struggle to find verified local services like electricians, plumbers, or tutors quickly.

How to Build with Spring Boot:

Spring Boot REST APIs for listing and searching local service providers.

Store ratings, locations, and availability in a database.

Geolocation-based search using Google Maps API or a simple radius filter.


Unique Value/Improvement:

Provides real-time availability and instant booking instead of just static contact details.

Could include peer verification badges to increase trust.
